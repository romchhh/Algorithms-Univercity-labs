# Sorting Visualizer with PyQt

![Sorting Visualizer Preview](https://github.com/romchhh/Algorithms-Univercity-labs/assets/123520267/8cb5d76a-36db-4dce-9ff0-9770ff1d6a34)

This project is a sorting visualizer implemented using PyQt. It allows users to either input a list manually or choose a file with a drag and drop system. Once the list is ready, users can initiate the sorting process with a click of a button.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop System**: Easily choose a file containing the list to be sorted.
- **Visualization**: See the sorting process in action, making it easier to understand how sorting algorithms work.
- **Theoretical and Practical Analysis**: Provides graphical representations for both theoretical and practical aspects of sorting algorithms.
